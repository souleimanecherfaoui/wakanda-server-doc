<ul>
<li><p><strong>Daily: a full backup of your application's data will occur every day at the time you have specified. An incremental backup is executed every hour.</strong> This frequency is suitable for applications in which data is critical and requires a fine level of restore points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weekly: a full backup of your application's data will occur every week at the day and time you have specified. An incremental backup is executed once every 6 hours.</strong> This type of frequency is a good compromise between the uptime of your application and the restore points available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monthly: a full backup of your application's data will occur every month at the date and time you have specified. An incremental backup is executed every 24 hours.</strong> If the uptime of your application is something you care about, this frequency is most suited for your application. The full backup is only performed once a month and lets you have daily restore points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./documentation/images/backups.png"/></p>
